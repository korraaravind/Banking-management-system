In the Banking Management System project, Eclipse IDE was pivotal for developing the core functionalities using Java. It provided a rich set of tools for code completion, syntax highlighting, and debugging, enabling efficient development and maintenance of the application. The IDE's plugin ecosystem also facilitated integration with version control systems like Git, ensuring smooth collaboration and code management.

MySQL Workbench was essential for designing and managing the project's database. Its visual design tools allowed for the creation of complex entity-relationship models, while its SQL editor enabled efficient query writing and execution. The tool's administration capabilities ensured that database performance and security were consistently monitored and optimized.

Postman was indispensable for API testing. It allowed for the creation of automated tests to ensure that API endpoints were functioning correctly, handling various edge cases and error scenarios. This ensured that the application's communication layer was robust and reliable, providing a seamless user experience.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) was used extensively for data interchange between the client and server. Its lightweight nature and ease of parsing made it ideal for transmitting complex data structures in a readable and efficient manner. This was particularly important for the banking system's dynamic features, such as
